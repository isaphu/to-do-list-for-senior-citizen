# Lucille: A To-Do App for the Elderly
A final deliverables as part of the course "Agile and Software Development" offered by Goldsmiths, University of London. 

> The purpose of this section is to present the tools and processes that were used during the
development of the application; explain the planning and management considerations that
underpinned the project; trace the path and timeline that the project took; and analyze the
reasons and dynamics that lead to it.

## Design

For the first functional prototype of the application, we started with the final version of the
“Notabook” prototype (Sharma et al., 2022, sec. Third prototype: Notabook). Individual elements
of the prototype were designed following literature recommendations on these subjects (Sharma
et al., 2022, chap. Literature review):
>1. Age-related changes to perception, cognition and motor function
>2. Elderlies’ personal and societal attitudes to technology and technology use
>3. User experience design recommendation for elderly users
>4. Models of technology acceptance among the general population and older users

## Challenges

> Here, we write about the code that brought about this feature. Any issue or challenge faced
when trying to program it. Any solution used and their sources (like stackoverflow). Any
interesting bit of code’s snippet. Any library or technology used to achieve this feature. Any
description that sells the idea that it was technically challenging and sort of new in the way we
did it.

## User testing and evaluation

> Usability Test: We decided to use the Usability Test as our method of assessment. To gain as much knowledge
from the user as possible, our planning, including selecting the best applicant to be invited to
our interview, developing the questions to be asked, and altering our interview flow, was rigorously tested internally.

### Summative Evaluation
> We extensively tested our prototypes with actual users before sending the same group a survey
asking them to review the finished product. They were asked to test our finished product and
provide a score ranging from 1 (least satisfied) to 5 (most satisfied).
