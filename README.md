# Lucille: A To-Do App for the Elderly
A final deliverables as part of the course "Agile and Software Development" offered by Goldsmiths, University of London. 

> The purpose of this section is to present the tools and processes that were used during the
development of the application; explain the planning and management considerations that
underpinned the project; trace the path and timeline that the project took; and analyze the
reasons and dynamics that lead to it.

## Design

For the first functional prototype of the application, we started with the final version of the
“Notabook” prototype (Sharma et al., 2022, sec. Third prototype: Notabook). Individual elements
of the prototype were designed following literature recommendations on these subjects (Sharma
et al., 2022, chap. Literature review):
>1. Age-related changes to perception, cognition and motor function
>2. Elderlies’ personal and societal attitudes to technology and technology use
>3. User experience design recommendation for elderly users
>4. Models of technology acceptance among the general population and older users
